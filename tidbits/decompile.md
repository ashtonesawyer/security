# Python
Compiles to `.pyc`

- Decompile with:
    - python2:`uncompyle2` found [here](https://github.com/Mysterie/uncompyle2).
    - python3: `uncompyle3` found [here](https://github.com/rocky/python-decompile3)
 
Above have annoying dependencies. For running decompiling python2 and python3 without root privs, use [this](https://github.com/zrax/pycdc). 
Decompiles to python2 and isn't 100% right, but close enough.

# Java
`.class` file

Decompile online with [javadecompilers.com](http://www.javadecompilers.com/) or locally
