# General Concept
Cross-site scripting is a WebSec vuln that allows attackers to circumvent the same 
origin policy and lets them masquerade as a victim user (able to carry out actions as them
and give access to their data). If they impersonate a privileged user, then they might be
able to gain full control over the app.
