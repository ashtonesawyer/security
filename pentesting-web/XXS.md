# General Concept
Cross-site scripting is a WebSec vuln that allows attackers to circumvent the same 
origin policy and lets them masquerade as a victim user (able to carry out actions as them
and give access to their data). If they impersonate a privileged user, then they might be
able to gain full control over the app. 

XXS manipulates a website so that it returns malicious JS to users. When the JS executes 
in the browser, the attacker can fully compromise the user's interaction with the application. 

# Detection
Can confirm most kinds by injecting a payload that causes your browser to execute some
arbitrary JS. Common practice to use the `alert()` function because it's hard to miss. 
In Chrome >=v92 cross-origin iframes (which are used to construct more advanced XXS attacks)
are prevented from calling `alert()` so PortSwigger recommends using `print()`
[[1]](https://portswigger.net/research/alert-is-dead-long-live-print).

# Types
| Type | Summary |
| ---- | ------- |
| Reflected XXS | Malicious script comes from the current HTTP request |
| Stored XXS | Malicious script comes from the website's database |
| DOM-Based XXS | The vulnerability is in the client-side code rather than server-side |

## Reflected XXS
Simplest variety. When and application receives data in an HTTP request
that includes the data within the immediate response in an unsafe way. 

If the site doesn't do any extra processing, the attacker can construct the URL
and if the user visits, the script will run as the user, giving it access to any action/data
the user has access to

```
Example:

  **intended use**
  https://insecure-site.com/status?message=All+is+well.
  <p>Status: All is well.</p>

  **attacker use**
  https://insecure-site.com/status?message=<script>...</script>
  <p>Status: <script>...</script>
```
